## Overview

Rather than build the gallery in HTML I decided to use JavaScript. This allows for easier changes to the team, since only the "people" object needs to be edited.

I experimented with using CSS columns to build the gallery, but grid seemed to be a better solution. However, it did necessitate using JS to calculate the correct number of rows. That worked well, though, and everything adjusts as necessary when people are added or removed.

### Built With

No frameworks, just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application following the provided design.
